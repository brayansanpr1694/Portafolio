      <section>
        <p>It all started when I heard Flutter allowed building apps for Android, iOS, web, and desktop — all from a single codebase. That instantly grabbed my attention.</p>

        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p>I installed the SDK, set up VSCode, and dove into the classic "Hello World" app. The hot reload speed blew me away — instant feedback is a game-changer.</p>

        <h2>The Dart Language</h2>
        <p>I was new to Dart, but quickly appreciated its clean syntax and async/await features. Learning about classes and widgets was the foundation that made Flutter click for me.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The secret lies in understanding the widget tree. Once you get that, everything flows naturally." — Probably me
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Firebase Integration</h2>
        <p>Adding Firebase was surprisingly straightforward using official packages. Real-time data syncing opened up new possibilities for my projects.</p>

        <h2>Dealing with Challenges</h2>
        <p>No journey is without bumps. I struggled initially with state management and navigation patterns. After exploring Provider and Riverpod, my apps became more scalable and maintainable.</p>

        <h2>Building My First App</h2>
        <p>Putting theory into practice, I created a simple task tracker app. Designing UI with Flutter's widget system was fun and intuitive. Deploying to both Android and iOS felt like magic.</p>

        <h2>Performance and Debugging</h2>
        <p>Flutter’s dev tools helped me identify performance bottlenecks quickly. The detailed error messages and widget inspector saved hours of headaches.</p>

        <h2>Why Flutter?</h2>
        <p>For me, Flutter’s ability to deliver a native-like experience across platforms without juggling multiple languages is unmatched. Plus, the active community and continuous improvements keep me excited to learn more.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Flutter empowered me to prototype and launch ideas rapidly. The best part? It just works everywhere. I’m looking forward to mastering it and building more ambitious projects.</p>

        <h2>Resources I Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://flutter.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official Flutter Docs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://dart.dev/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dart Language Guide</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase for Flutter</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://pub.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dart Packages Repository</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>Next on my roadmap is diving deeper into animations, custom widgets, and exploring Flutter Web. Stay tuned!</p>
